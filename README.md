# AI-with-human-recognition
the development of an advanced artificial intelligence system designed for human recognition, a comprehensive image dataset to train deep learning models.This involves the use of convolutional neural networks and potentially other machine learning techniques to analyze visual data, enhance feature extraction, and improve recognition accuracy.  The system aims to address common issues in facial recognition technologies, such as changes in lighting, occlusions, and different facial expressions, thereby pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in automated personal identification.
 By integrating rigorous privacy standards and ethical guidelines into the design process, the system is tailored to ensure user data protection and consent. This human-centric approach not only enhances the system's utility in practical scenarios, such as security and personalized services, but also aligns with global standards for ethical AI practices. The expected outcomes include a scalable model that can be deployed in various sectors, offering a balance between high technical performance and stringent ethical compliance.
